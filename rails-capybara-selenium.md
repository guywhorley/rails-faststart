# Introduction

After spending more that few frustrated hours of trying to get Rails, Rspec, Capybara, and Selenium Webriver to play nicely together,
I am documenting which gems and files I updated to finally make the browser magically work all by itself. (Look ma, no hands' on the keyboard yet I am filling in form fields === BY THE POWER OF MY MIND! Hey ... no one else needs to know that it is actually the
selenium webdriver that is powering it all. Or you could put it down to evil spirits trying to inhabit the computer - and the charge 
a hefty fee to exercise the demons from the computer. Your call.)
